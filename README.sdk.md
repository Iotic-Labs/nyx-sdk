🌟 **Nyx Client SDK** provides a powerful toolkit for building generative AI applications using data brokered on the Nyx platform.

It enables decentralized data transfer, offering additional context (via a RAG setup) to language models within the trusted IOTICS network.

## 🚧 Status

The Nyx ecosystem is at an early stage of its development, please give us feedback through the [Github issues](https://github.com/Iotic-Labs/nyx-sdk/issues).

## What is the Nyx Client SDK

The Nyx Client SDK is a Python library that provides an API for easy interaction with the Nyx Platform. It enables end users to seamlessly connect their data to the Nyx ecosystem, search for data, subscribe to it, and consume it. With this SDK, users can ultimately build powerful AI applications.

Several examples of SDK usage in an AI context are available:

- [RAG demo examples](https://github.com/Iotic-Labs/nyx-sdk/tree/main/examples)
- `https://[nyx_host]/try-me-now`

# 🔥 Quick Start

## Installation

The Nyx Client SDK is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nyx-client/) and can be installed via `pip` running the following command.

`pip install nyx-client`

## First time set up

Once the library is installed you can run `nyx-client init` to generate the .env file. You'll be asked to provide your Nyx username, password and Nyx endpoint.

## As a data producer

### I want to connect my Data

```python
from nyx_client import NyxClient

client = NyxClient()
client.create_data(
    name="MyData1",
    title="My Data #1",
    description="The description of the data #1",
    size=1080,
    genre="ai",
    categories=["cat1", "cat2", "cat3"],
    download_url="http://storage/dataset1.csv",
    content_type="text/csv",
    lang="fr",
    preview="col1, col2, col3\naaa, bbb, ccc",
    license_url="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",
)
```

### I want to delete/disconnect my Data

```python
from nyx_client import NyxClient

client = NyxClient()
client.delete_data_by_name(name="MyData1")
```

## As an application builder

### I want to subscribe to some data

Coming soon 👷🚧

### I want to consume the data

```python
from nyx_client import NyxClient

client = NyxClient()
subscribed_data = client.get_subscribed_data()
for data in subscribed_data:
  print(f"Downloading data {data.name}")
  content = data.download()
```

## 👉 Gotchas

- If the Data has been deleted/disconnected from Nyx, the SDK will no longer be able to access it. Ensure that the data is still available.

The Nyx ecosystem is at an early stage of its development, please give us feedback through [Github issues](https://github.com/Iotic-Labs/nyx-sdk/issues).
