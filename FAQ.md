## Question: What is Nyx?

<details open>
<summary>Answer: </summary>
Nyx is a revolutionary, decentralised technology that addresses the principal challenge to the adoption of AI within enterprise: secure, trusted access to domain-specific, contextualised and real-time data. Nyx brings together communities of proprietary data producers and data consumers in a secure, transparent, and user-friendly environment, and integrated into AI workflows.

## Question: Does Nyx use blockchain for its decentralised architecture?

<details open>
<summary>Answer: </summary>
No. However, Nyx does incorporate the concept of Decentralised IDs (found in ‘Web3’ architectures) to enable self-sovereignty, and we continue to consider ways blockchain might be useful for sharing data in the future.

## Question: Does Nyx use GenAI?

<details open>
<summary>Answer: </summary>
No, Nyx does not leverage any Generative AI models in the provision of the data exchange.  The Nyx architecture incorporates semantic capabilities including Inference, a type of logical reasoning.  The ‘Try it Now’ feature in the Nyx Community Edition includes a RAG-enabled chatbot demonstrator which incorporates integrations with LLMs.

## Question: What makes Nyx different from file sharing platforms (e.g. Sharepoint)?

<details open>
<summary>Answer: </summary>
Traditional approaches to data sharing with tools like Sharepoint make a number of assumptions about the world: everyone knows what data is available, everyone knows what the data means;, and when access is required, it can be granted safely.  None of those assumptions are generally true in most real-world organisations or ecosystems.  Instead, data is everywhere, owned by lots of different people, each of whom has a unique lens through which they view that data, and not everyone trusts each other.  As a result, traditional means of sharing data can be ineffective and insecure. 

Nyx leverages a unique, decentralised architecture designed ‘bottom-up’ for secure, selective interoperability at the data tier.  Nyx combines streaming, knowledge graph, semantics, virtualisation and decentralisation to deliver interoperability in the real world, making real-time and static data discoverable, understandable and accessible across organisations and ecosystems, while ensuring that each participant retains sovereignty of their own systems and data.

## Question: What data will be available for me to use if I try out Nyx?

<details open>
